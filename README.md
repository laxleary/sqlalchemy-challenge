# SQLAlchemy Challenge

## Module 10 Challenge

### Overview

This repository uses SQLAlchemy and Flask to explore climate date in Honolulu, Hawaii and to create an application to allow users to access this data from a Flask API. First, SQLALchemy was used in Jupyter Notebooks to construct a basic exploration of the data and to plot some of the data with Pandas to view general trends. Pieces of the explorative code were then used while constructing a Flask application to query the database and store desired information as JSON in our API. 

### Outside Sources

The following code was developed solely by me, with no assistance from other students, instructors, tutors, or TAs. Most code was developed using tools seen in class, with the following exceptions:
- Flask documentation used to check how to ignore code that looks like HTML but is not: (the < start > and < end > blocks) were being read as HTML
- HTML documentation used to learn how to insert hyperlinks into the page, so that non-variable endpoints could be accessed with more ease
- Research into creating a search bar on the page for the sake of the start and end date queries, but this involved significantly more web development skills than we currently have so I did not include it
